MILESTONES
 - basically copy/paste bits from example program and change random things
 - test program to increase/decrease the volume of an sq1

MISTAKES

{PPUDATA}(@titles[i+title_offset])
 - originally used {} to access @titles, but i and title_offset are both U types

U TITLE_LEN = len(titles) >> 5
 - how to declare this as an int?

No way to put a pointer in a struct???? Have to cast to UUU

Tons of problems with an array of structs in vars

 SUGGESTIONS (mostly for docs)
 - .a and .b appear to be undocumented
 - would be nice to explicitly say how PAAs should be inited
